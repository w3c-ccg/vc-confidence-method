This specification defines the Confidence Method property that can be used
with the the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM). An issuer can
include one or more Confidence Methods in a verifiable credential to inform
verifiers of mechanisms they could use to increase their confidence in the
truth of a variety of things, including the following:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
a particular identifier in the verifiable credential refers to the same entity
the issuer intended it to refer to,
    </li>
    <li>
an entity, such as the presenter of a verifiable credential, is the same entity
that the issuer made claims about,
    </li>
    <li>
an entity controls, or has been designated to use, one or more mechanisms for
demonstrating proof-of-possession or proof-of-use of cryptographic key
material,
    </li>
    <li>
an entity identified in the verifiable credential can be checked against a
biometric.
    </li>
  </ul>

            The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the

         <h2>Confidence Method</h2>
        <p>
This specification defines the <code>confidenceMethod</code> <a>property</a>
for expressing confidence method information in a
<code>credentialSubject</code> in a <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>verifier</a> can decide to accept <a>claims</a> in a <a>verifiable
credential</a> without requiring use of the confidence method, or use a
different mechanism to increase their confidence about whether, for
example, the <a>holder</a> is the same <a>entity</a> the issuer made
<a>claims</a> about in the <a>verifiable credential</a>. Such a decision
can impact the <a>verifier</a>'s liability or lack thereof if not
specified by other means such as a <code>termsOfUse</code> policy.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>
For example, an <a>issuer</a> can include a confidence method based on public
key cryptography in the <a>verifiable credential</a>. A <a>holder</a> can
demonstrate they are able to generate and include a <a>proof</a> with a
cryptographic signature in the <a>verifiable presentation</a> that will verify
against the verification key expressed in the confidence method in the
embedded <a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
A <a>verifier</a> can validate that the <a>holder</a> controls,
or has been designated the ability to use, a confidence method
by verifying the <a>proof</a> of the <a>verifiable
presentation</a> using the information in the confidence method. The
confidence method can include the verification key, or the type of the
confidence method can define that the verification key is to be inferred from
other <a>properties</a> in the <a>verifiable credential</a>, such as the
<code>credentialSubject.id</code>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>confidenceMethod</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
          <dd>
            <p>
If present, the value of the <code>confidenceMethod</code> <a>property</a> is
one or more confidence methods. Each confidence method is bound to one or more
claims in the <a>verifiable credential</a>, and provides enough information for a
<a>verifier</a> to determine whether the <a>holder</a> can generate a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> to increase the <a>verifier's</a> confidence
that they are the same <a>entity</a> referenced by the confidence method.
This is referred to as satisfying the confidence method. It is required that
the <a>issuer</a> verifies the <a>holder</a> can satisfy each
<code>confidenceMethod</code> the <a>issuer</a> includes in the
<a>claims</a> of the <a>verifiable credential</a>s they issue.
            </p>
            <p>
Each confidence method MUST specify its <code>type</code> and MAY specify an
<code>id</code>. The precise <a>properties</a> and semantics of each
confidence method are determined by the specific
<code>confidenceMethod</code> type definition.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
The following example demonstrates a confidence method based on proving
possession of a cryptographic key. The corresponding public key is a
type-specific property of the confidence method.

        <p class="note">
A confidence method can express various metadata such as the <a>issuer</a>'s
level of confidence that the <a>holder</a> is the entity referenced by a
<a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credential</a>, specific form factors or
mechanisms of authenticators, and/or references to other <a>verifiable credentials</a>
or versioned trust frameworks. For example, an <a>issuer</a> can make a
<a>claim</a> about a confidence method that is based on a cryptographic key
pair, but to produce a signature using that key, the <a>holder</a> has to unlock
a device using multi-factor authentication.
