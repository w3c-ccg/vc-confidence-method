This specification defines a mechanism that can be used with the
[[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] to increase a [=verifier|verifier's=] confidence about a
particular [=subject=] identified in a [=verifiable credential=].
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It is
not fit for production deployment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
When a [=verifier=] performs the process of [=validate|validating=] a
[=verifiable credential=], it is useful to be able to raise the confidence level
that the [=subjects=] identified in a [=verifiable credential=] are the same
ones that interacted with the [=issuer=] when it performed its vetting process
to issue the [=verifiable credential=]. For example, when an employer (the
[=issuer=]) issues a corporate identification card to an employee (the
[=subject=]), it might require that the employee bind a particular cryptographic
key (<a data-cite="VC-DATA-INTEGRITY#verification-method">verification
method</a>) to the [=verifiable credential=] during the issuing process. In that
case, the [=issuer=] can use this specification to convey to the [=verifier=]
which cryptographic key was bound during the initial identity assurance process.
      </p>

      <p>
In other words, an [=issuer=] can use this specification to convey which
provable mechanisms it used to bind [=claims=] in a [=verifiable credential=] so
that a [=verifier=] can increase their confidence in the truth of a variety of
things, including the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
a particular identifier in the [=verifiable credential=] refers to the same
[=subject=] the issuer intended it to refer to,
        </li>
        <li>
a [=subject=], such as the [=presentation|presenter=] of a [=verifiable
credential=], is the same [=subject=] that the [=issuer=] made [=claims=] about,
        </li>
        <li>
a [=subject=] [=controller|controls=], or has been designated to use, one or
more mechanisms for demonstrating proof-of-possession of cryptographic key
material,
        </li>
        <li>
a [=subject=] identified in the [=verifiable credential=] can be checked against
a biometric.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Confidence Method</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines the `confidenceMethod` property
        for expressing confidence method information in a
        `credentialSubject` in a [=verifiable credential=].
      </p>

      <p>
        A [=verifier=] can decide to accept [=claims=] in a <a>verifiable
          credential</a> without requiring use of the confidence method, or use a
        different mechanism to increase their confidence about whether, for
        example, the [=holder=] is the same entity the issuer made
        [=claims=] about in the [=verifiable credential=]. Such a decision
        can impact the [=verifier=]'s liability or lack thereof if not
        specified by other means such as a `termsOfUse` policy.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          For example, an [=issuer=] can include a confidence method based on public
          key cryptography in the [=verifiable credential=]. A [=holder=] can
          demonstrate they are able to generate and include a [=data integrity proof|proof=] with a
          cryptographic signature in the [=verifiable presentation=] that will verify
          against the verification key expressed in the confidence method in the
          embedded [=verifiable credential=].
        </p>
        <p>
          A [=verifier=] can validate that the [=holder=] controls,
          or has been designated the ability to use, a confidence method
          by verifying the [=data integrity proof|proof=] of the <a>verifiable
            presentation</a> using the information in the confidence method. The
          confidence method can include the verification key, or the type of the
          confidence method can define that the verification key is to be inferred from
          other properties in the [=verifiable credential=], such as the
          `credentialSubject.id`.
        </p>
      </div>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>confidenceMethod</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
        <dd>
          <p>
            If present, the value of the `confidenceMethod` property is
            one or more confidence methods. Each confidence method is bound to one or more
            claims in the [=verifiable credential=], and provides enough information for a
            [=verifier=] to determine whether the [=holder=] can generate a
            [=verifiable presentation=] to increase the [=verifier's=] confidence
            that they are the same entity referenced by the confidence method.
            This is referred to as satisfying the confidence method. It is required that
            the [=issuer=] verifies the [=holder=] can satisfy each
            `confidenceMethod` the [=issuer=] includes in the
            [=claims=] of the [=verifiable credential=]s they issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each confidence method MUST specify its `type` and MAY specify an
            `id`. The precise properties and semantics of each
            confidence method are determined by the specific
            `confidenceMethod` type definition.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        The following example demonstrates a confidence method based on proving
        possession of a cryptographic key. The corresponding public key is a
        type-specific property of the confidence method.

      <p class="note">
A confidence method can express various metadata such as the [=issuer=]'s level
of confidence that the [=holder=] is the [=subject=] of the [=verifiable
credential=], specific form factors or mechanisms of authenticators, and/or
references to other [=verifiable credentials=] or versioned trust frameworks.
For example, an [=issuer=] can make a [=claim=] about a confidence method that
is based on a cryptographic key pair, but to produce a signature using that key,
the [=holder=] has to unlock a device using multi-factor authentication.

        <ul>
          <li>
Since confidence methods can be selectively disclosed, verifiers need to
explicitly ask for confidence methods in high-assurance use cases when
dealing with proof mechanisms that allow for selective or unlinkable disclosure.

Add privacy considerations section that includes at least the following topics:
        <ul>
          <li>
Confidence methods are expected to be selectively disclosed, as they might not
be necessary in many low-assurance use cases, or where high-assurance is
achieved through a different means such as in-person verification against a
photo.
